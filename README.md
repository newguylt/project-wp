# Newguylt project

Since my web development course started 2018-12-03, this project saw the light about 3 weeks later using my html,css,javascript and wordpress knowledge that i've acquired during the course. First version uploaded here is the final version that I had to present to the class 2019-01-09.

This project is a representation of what I've learnt during my month long course but doesn't reflect everything that I am able to do with code.
